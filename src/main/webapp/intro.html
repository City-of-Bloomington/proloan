Note: To enter a new loan, the client and the property related info need 
to be entered separately. It is better to enter the client info, then the
property, then the loan. If the client and/or property are in the system, no
need to reentered again as they can be selected from the options. 
Please Select one of the options in the left panel.

<ul>
<li> To add a new client, select New Client.
<li> To add a new property, select New Property.
<li> To add a new loan, select  New Loan.
<li> To search for clients, properties or clients select the related 
     search option.
<li> The report option provides a number of useful reports that are needed
    on monthly, annually or any periodic basis.
<li> Logout from the system when done to protect the system.
